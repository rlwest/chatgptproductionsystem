This project is to build a very simple and transparent computational architecture for building cognitive architectures. 

Ideally this project will include cognitive architectures built on this computational architecture

And these cognitive architectures will be used to run models that will match well to human behaviors

This project is for:
- students so they can more easily understand the relationship between computation and cognition
- software developers who want to implement a cognitive architecture and need a clear description of it


Assumptions of the computational architecture
